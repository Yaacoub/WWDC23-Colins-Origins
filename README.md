## ‚úã To-do before running

- In rare cases, build errors occur. Cleaning the build folder should be the solution.
- Please set the destination as "My Mac (Designed for iPad)" and run the app on fullscreen for the best possible experience.

## üí≠ Things to consider

- Building this project started one week after the challenge announcement due to classes, but I'm not making excuses!
- Conceiving game mechanics aimed at children and adults is no easy game, but I did my best!
- Creating all visual and sound assets was one of my objectives every time I participated. This time I did it!
- Gathering knowledge from my older submissions was essential, especially for UIKit, SwiftUI, and SpriteKit.
- Realizing that I could have made the game on one level, I still kept the objective of making the learning process enjoyable and understandable.
- Taking the opportunity of making this project to learn new concepts is always one of my goals. This year: color theory!
- Wishing to speed up the experience, you can tap on the text bubble to skip the typing animation!

## üêû Known issues

- Changing the AVAudioPlayer's volume or having two instances play simultaneously for the first time causes minor audio artifacts and stutter.
- Having UIView animations running, presenting a new view controller, and then going back stops them. It's not clear if this is intended behavior.

## üåû Inspiration

- A mash of years-old ideas I had saved in my notes.
- Family!
- Mixing art and technology, just like last year!

## ü•ö Easter Eggs

- Colin's name derives from the word "Color" and beautifully rhymes with "Origin".
- Shay's name derives from the word "Shade", which is terminology for a color mixed with black.
- Colin and Shay are coincidentally both Gaelic names.
- When the clouds hide part of the sun or the moon, the scene dims down.
- In most levels, Colin and Shay appear from the side in new and unexpected ways.
- Throughout the levels, the sky has the same hue. Only the brightness and saturation appropriately change.
- There are fewer cars during the dawn than the day, and no cars at night.
- Levels 1.3, 2.3, and 3.4 have a wordplay in their title, as probably all titles should.
- In Level 3.1, the dialog ends with Shay being sad. Colin is alone in pushing Shay to exit the scene.

There are undoubtedly more that I forgot to mention!
